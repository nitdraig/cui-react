## Principles and Guidelines
### Simplicity
Prioritize simplicity in all aspects of design. Eliminate unnecessary elements to maintain an intuitive user experience.

### Minimalism
Adopt a minimalist approach in UI design. Use only essential elements to effectively communicate information and avoid visual clutter.

### Modernity
Keep your design system up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in UI/UX design. This includes responsive design techniques, subtle animations, and user-centered design.

### Flexibility and Modifiability
Design your system to be easily modifiable and adaptable to different needs and contexts. Use variables, reusable components, and scalable design patterns to facilitate customization and system expansion.

### Coherence
Ensure all design elements follow a consistent set of rules and guidelines. This includes consistency in color palette, typography, spacing, and icon usage throughout the system.

### Accessibility
Design with accessibility in mind to ensure your system is usable by people with diverse abilities and needs. Follow web accessibility guidelines, such as ensuring adequate color contrast and providing textual alternatives for non-text elements.

### Scalability
Design your system with scalability in mind to grow and adapt as your product evolves. This involves considering system architecture, file organization, and clear documentation to facilitate maintenance and expansion.

### Usability
Prioritize usability in your system design. This means making interactions intuitive and easy to understand for users, minimizing the need for learning and reducing the possibility of errors.
